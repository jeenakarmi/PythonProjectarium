# PythonProjectarium

Welcome to the PythonProjectarium! This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly Python projects that I learned and practiced for fundamental programming concepts. Each project is self-contained and demonstrates different aspects of Python programming.

These projects are done using Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to follow along and execute the code interactively. 
###
Feel free to explore each project, experiment with the code, and have fun learning Python!
